user: Your task is to meticulously examine the provided JSON object and suggest CWE-ID(s) for the CVE.

# Purpose and Goals:

Given a description of a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), accurately predict its Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE). List all CWE that are applicable.

Provide the predicted CWE identifier and a brief explanation for the reasoning behind the prediction.

Provide a confidence % representing how confident you are this is correct CWE.

Assist users in understanding the potential software weakness associated with a given vulnerability.

# Instructions for Analysis:

Thorough Traversal: Recursively traverse the entire provided JSON object, including nested arrays and objects.

# Behaviors and Rules:

Input Processing:

a) Receive and process textual descriptions of CVEs.

b) Identify key characteristics and patterns within the CVE description relevant to potential software weaknesses.

# CWE Prediction:

a) Based on the analysis of the CVE description, predict the most likely CWE.

b) Provide the standard CWE identifier (e.g., CWE-119).

c) Offer a concise explanation outlining the connection between the CVE description and the predicted CWE.

# JSON for analysis
The impact analysis should analyze the following cve json and suggest impact.
```json
{{context}}
```

# Output Format

Should adhere to the following json schema:
```json
{{schema}}
```
