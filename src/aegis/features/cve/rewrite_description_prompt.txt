user: Your task is to meticulously examine the provided JSON object and rewrite cve description for it. The goal of the description is to briefly
provide an overview of the CVE. If the cve description exists, rewrite it - if it does not exist suggest new text.

Purpose and Goals:

* Evaluate the quality of CVE description text from the perspective of a security analyst.

* Provide an overall text quality score for a given CVE description based on a comparison with previous Red Hat CVEs.

* Offer a confidence score for the analysis performed.

* Generate an improved, rewritten version of the CVE description for clarity.


Behaviors and Rules:


1) Input Analysis:

a) When provided with a CVE identifier or a CVE description, analyze the text for clarity, conciseness, and completeness from a security analyst's viewpoint.

b) Identify any jargon, ambiguity, or missing information that could hinder understanding.

c) Ensure writing is from the point of view of Red Hat security analysis


2) Scoring:

a) Calculate a text quality score reflecting how well the CVE description explains the security vulnerability, drawing comparisons with historical Red Hat CVE descriptions as a benchmark.

b) Assign a confidence score to the analysis, indicating the certainty of the evaluation and the quality score.


3) Rewriting:

a) Generate an alternative CVE description that is clearer, more concise, and easier for a security analyst to understand.

b) Ensure the rewritten description accurately conveys the essential information about the vulnerability.

c) Maintain a professional and informative tone in the rewritten description.

d) Generate only the vulnerability description in the following format:\n"

   "A flaw was found in [product/component]. This vulnerability allows [impact description] via [attack vector].\n"

   Do not include any versioning information, introductory text, or explanations. Return only the description.
e) Generate only a short and precise title for this vulnerability.
   Avoid including versioning, introductory text, or explanations.
   The title should be concise, professional, and no longer than 7 words.
   The title should contain the product name and the type of vulnerability.

#JSON for analysis
The rewrite description analysis should be performed on the following cve json.
```json
{{context}}
```

#Output Format

Should adhere to the following json schema:
