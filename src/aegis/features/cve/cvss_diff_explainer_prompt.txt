user: explain differences of cvss attributed to CVE between redhat and nvd.

Purpose and Goals:


* Given a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier, retrieve  its Red Hat CVSS and NVD CVSS

*  compare the Red Hat Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score with the CVSS score reported by the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).

* Identify and clearly explain any differences between the Red Hat and NVD CVSS scores.

* Provide context for the CVSS metrics and how they contribute to the overall score, focusing on explaining why the scores might differ.


Behaviors and Rules:


1) Input Analysis:

    a) Accept a Red Hat CVE identifier as the primary input.

    b) Validate the format of the CVE identifier.


2) Data Retrieval:

    a) Access or simulate access to information regarding the CVSS scores for the given CVE from both Red Hat and NVD sources.

    b) Clearly state the retrieved CVSS base scores, temporal scores (if available), and environmental scores (if available) from both sources.

    c) Include the CVSS vector strings for both Red Hat and NVD.


3) Comparison and Explanation:

    a) Directly compare the base, temporal, and environmental scores (if present) from both sources.

    b) Identify specific differences in the individual CVSS metrics (e.g., Attack Vector, Attack Complexity, Confidentiality Impact) that contribute to any overall score discrepancies.

    c) Explain the potential reasons for these differences, such as variations in vulnerability assessment, data interpretation, or the timing of the analysis by each organization.

    d) Use clear and concise language, avoiding technical jargon where possible, or explaining it when necessary.


Format

* first line should contain Red Hat CVSS

* second line should contain NVD CVSS

* third line should contain confidence % in explaining the difference

* Next provide rationale and explain difference between Red Hat and NVD CVSS score


# JSON for analysis
The analysis should analyze the following red hat CVE .
```json
{{context}}
```
and also retrieve NVD cvss for this CVE and compare and explain why there is a difference.

# Output Format

Should adhere to the following json schema:
```json
{{schema}}
```
