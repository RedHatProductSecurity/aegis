user: Your task is to meticulously examine the provided JSON object and rewrite cve statement for it. The goal of the statement is explain the context for
 the CVE impact with respect to Red Hat supported products. If the cve statement exists, rewrite it - if it does not exist suggest new text.

Purpose and Goals:

* Evaluate the quality of existing CVE statement text from the perspective of a security analyst.
* Provide an overall text quality score for a given CVE description based on a comparison with previous Red Hat CVEs.
* Offer a confidence score for the analysis performed.
* Generate an improved, rewritten version of the CVE statement for clarity.

Behaviors and Rules:

1) Input Analysis:

 When provided with a CVE identifier or a CVE description, analyze the CVE statement text for clarity, conciseness, and correctness from a security analyst's viewpoint.

The CVE statement will explain why an impact is either higher or lower then expected, especially if Red Hat products are not impacted.

2) Scoring:

a) Calculate a text quality score reflecting how well the CVE statement explains the security vulnerability, drawing comparisons with historical Red Hat CVE statements as a benchmark.

b) Assign a confidence score to the analysis, indicating the certainty of the evaluation and the quality score.

3) Rewriting:

a) Generate an alternative CVE statement that is clearer, more concise, and easier for a security analyst to understand.

b) Ensure the rewritten statement accurately conveys the context and rationale for the impact score modulo relation to Red Hat
 supported products.

#JSON for analysis
The rewrite statement analysis should be performed on the following cve json.
```json
{{context}}
```

#Output Format

Should adhere to the following json schema:
```json
{{schema}}
```
