user: Your task is to meticulously examine the provided JSON object and rewrite cve statement for it. The goal of the statement is explain the context for
 the CVE impact with respect to Red Hat supported products. If the cve statement exists, rewrite it - if it does not exist suggest new text.

# Purpose and Goals:

* Evaluate the quality of existing CVE statement text from the perspective of a security analyst.
* Provide an overall text quality score for a given CVE description based on a comparison with previous Red Hat CVEs.
* Offer a confidence score for the analysis performed.
* Generate an improved, rewritten version of the CVE statement for clarity.

# Behaviors and Rules:

1) Input Analysis:

 When provided with a CVE identifier or a CVE description, analyze the CVE statement text for clarity, conciseness, and correctness from a security analyst's viewpoint.

The CVE statement will explain why an impact is either higher or lower than expected, especially if Red Hat products are not impacted.

2) Scoring:

a) Calculate a text quality score reflecting how well the CVE statement explains the security vulnerability, drawing comparisons with historical Red Hat CVE statements as a benchmark.

b) Assign a confidence score to the analysis, indicating the certainty of the evaluation and the quality score.

3) Rewriting:

a) Generate an alternative CVE statement that is clearer, more concise, and easier for a security analyst to understand.

b) Ensure the rewritten statement accurately conveys the context and rationale for the impact score modulo relation to Red Hat
 supported products.


# Further Guidelines to Writing a Comprehensive Vulnerability Statement

This document outlines the methodology and best practices for writing a detailed vulnerability statement. A well-structured vulnerability statement enables better understanding, prioritization, and remediation of vulnerabilities. It integrates critical concepts for threat categorization and risk assessment to ensure comprehensive coverage, while also aligning with CVSS version 3.1 metrics.

## 1. Formula for Writing a Vulnerability Statement

The formula for constructing a proper vulnerability statement is as follows:

**In what component vulnerability was found + Where vulnerability exists + Which vulnerability was found + How it is taking place + What is its impact**

**Example**

**Statement:** A vulnerability was found in **Vim** in the **xyz.c** file in the **abc() function**. It is an **out-of-bounds (OOB) read** triggered when an **input file begins with #!**, leading to a **crash and potential denial of service (DoS)**.

This structure ensures that all critical aspects of a vulnerability are covered in a concise and actionable manner.

## 2. How STRIDE, CVSS, and the CIA Triad Form a Comprehensive Statement

### STRIDE for Threat Categorization

**STRIDE** is a framework that helps categorize threats based on their characteristics and impact. These categories are:

* **Spoofing:** An attacker impersonates a legitimate entity to gain unauthorized access.
* **Tampering:** The unauthorized modification of data or code.
* **Repudiation:** Actions that lack proper accountability, making it difficult to trace malicious activity.
* **Information Disclosure:** Exposure of sensitive data to unauthorized entities.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Disruption of services, rendering them unavailable.
* **Elevation of Privilege:** An attacker gains access to higher-level privileges, enabling full control over a system.

By understanding which category a vulnerability falls into, the statement can highlight the nature of the threat and its potential impact on the system.

### Integrating CVSS Version 3.1

Using **CVSS** metrics ensures that the vulnerability statement addresses critical aspects such as:

* How the issue can be accessed (e.g., via network or locally).
* The complexity of triggering the issue.
* The level of permissions required to exploit it.
* The potential impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

By aligning the statement with these metrics, the severity and context are immediately clear, aiding in prioritization.

### Incorporating the CIA Triad

The impact of the vulnerability is assessed through its effects on:

* **Confidentiality:** Whether sensitive information can be accessed or exposed.
* **Integrity:** Whether the system or its data can be altered in unauthorized ways.
* **Availability:** Whether the system or service can remain operational.

These impacts should be seamlessly integrated into the statement to paint a complete picture of the vulnerability's consequences.

## 3. Example Statement Combining All Elements

### Example 1

**Statement:** A flaw in the **OpenSSL library** in the **tls13_enc.c file** within the **process_early_data() function** arises when **specially crafted network inputs cause a buffer overflow**. This issue enables **unintended code execution**, which results in **unauthorized system access**. **Sensitive data might be exposed, critical configurations altered, and service availability significantly disrupted**.

### Example 2

**Statement:** The **Apache HTTP Server’s mod_rewrite.c module mishandles overly large input strings in rewrite rules**. This leads to an **integer overflow**, causing **system crashes**. These crashes **disrupt service availability, preventing legitimate users from accessing the system**.

### Example 3

**Statement:** A **session token validation issue** in the **XYZ application** arises when **malformed tokens are processed**. This allows **attackers to impersonate legitimate users, gaining access to sensitive data and modifying system settings**. Such actions **undermine both data confidentiality and system integrity**.

---

## 4. Best Practices for Writing a Statement

* **Clarity:** Use precise and straightforward language.
* **Completeness:** Include all critical elements (component, location, vulnerability type, trigger, and impact).
* **Relevance:** Provide context to highlight the vulnerability’s significance.
* **Alignment:** Ensure statements address CVSS metrics, including how the issue is accessed, its complexity, and its impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
* **Consistency:** Maintain uniform structure and terminology across statements.

By embedding STRIDE-based threat categorization, CVSS alignment, and the CIA triad into a single cohesive statement, vulnerabilities can be effectively communicated and prioritized for resolution.

#CVE for analysis
The rewrite statement analysis should be performed on CVE with id of {{cve_id}}.

#Output Format

Should adhere to the following json schema:
