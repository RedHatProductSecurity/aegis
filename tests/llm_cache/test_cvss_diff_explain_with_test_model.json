    "statement": "This CVE is not applicable to any supported version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux since RHEL-4.",
    "explanation": "The fundamental difference in the CVSS scores between Red Hat and NVD for CVE-2025-0725 lies in the assessment of the 'Attack Vector' (AV) metric. Red Hat has assigned an AV of 'Local' (AV:L), whereas NVD has assigned 'Network' (AV:N).\n\nRed Hat's 'Local' rating is based on the context of its products, where the vulnerable component is not directly exposed to the network, thus requiring an attacker to have prior local access to the system to exploit the vulnerability.\n\nIn contrast, NVD's 'Network' rating reflects a more general assessment of the vulnerability, considering that `libcurl` is a library that can be and is often used in network-facing applications. This difference in the Attack Vector is the primary reason for the variance in the CVSS scores."
